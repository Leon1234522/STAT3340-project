Abstract: This article uses data from the Fish Market Dataset from LionBridge which shows the relationship of body length, width, height, and weight in Bream, Roach, Whitefish, Parkki, Perche, Smelt, seven species in the first alphabetic order. We hypothesized that weight in these species was positively related to length, width, and height. We use multiple linear regression and multiple regression model to analyze the linear and non-linear relation between the data in the dataset, through the analysis of the correlation coefficient and the backward of the selection of the final model, the length2 and length3 did not produce relationship with weight, so our final model is the weight and length of 1, species, height between the regression model. Weight and length1, species and height have relationship, which confirmed our hypothesis.
